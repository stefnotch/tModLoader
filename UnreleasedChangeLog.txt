1.3.4: mods related changelog
  -Deprecated Net Messages 26, 44 - they were replaced by 117 & 118 respectively.
  -Changed the arguments for Player.Hurt & Player.KillMe - both now contains a mandatory PlayerDeathReason damage source.
  -Added NPC.lifeRegenExpectedLossPerSecond - it defaults at '-1' , setting it to a value higher than 0 (such as 5) will make enemy DOT debuffs use the number for their number popup ticks...
  -Added 'melee hit' damage scaling for all appropriate types of damage instead of just melee (so you can have a swinging magic weapon with proper crit chance and damage)
